    <p>
      My approach is highly personal--I will work with you to find the right combination of psychotherapy,
      integrative treatment modalities and, if desired, medications. Patients often describe me as a
      compassionate doctor who "gets it".

    <p>
      I treat most adult psychiatric disorders, with a special interest in using integrative medical mental health focus on eating disorders, addictions, mood and anxiety disorders,
      women's reproductive psychiatry, and ADHD.  My psychotherapeutic focus is on the treatment of underlying personality conflicts that food,
      substances, and other addictions often mask.
