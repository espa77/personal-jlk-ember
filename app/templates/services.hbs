    Dr. Kraker sees adult patients age 18-65. While she sees patients from all walks of life, patients ready for change who are motivated for treatment are typical in my practice and have the highest likelihood of success.

  <h1 class="heading brown">INITIAL CONSULTATION - 60min</h1>
  <p>
    For new patients, or those looking for a second opinion, we will meet for 60 minutes for a medical and psychiatric consultation. We will discuss the nature of your concerns, take a 360 degree review of your life, and discuss your goals, expectations and collaborate on personalized treatment options. The initial plan often includes next steps of a diagnostic work up by way of laboratory and genetic testing.
  </p>

  <h1 class="heading brown">INTEGRATIVE MEDICAL PSYCHIATRY - 45min</h1>
  <p>
    If you are interested in optimizing your mental health without traditional medications, I offer a comprehensive work up exploring  your nutritional status, hormone balance, level of inflammation, stress, and genetics to allow your brain to thrive. I use evidence based targeted nutritional interventions, herbal remedies, biofeedback, and other treatment alternatives for optimal brain function.
  </p>

  <h1 class="heading brown">NUTRITIONAL PSYCHIATRY - 45min</h1>
  <p>
    Whether you are interested in treatment for an eating disorder, or want to examine how your current nutritional habits effect your mood or performance—I will look closely not only the quality and quantity of your food choices, but dive deep into your relationship with food and help you break habits that may not serve you, and add practices that can optimize your brain health.
  </p>
  <h1 class="heading brown">PSYCHOTHERAPY - 45min</h1>
  <p>
    Individual therapy helps when you are experiencing arduous circumstances—such as relationship stress, family strain, career frustrations, worry, life transitions and times of crisis—to live your most meaningful life. My approach is equally compassionate and firm in helping you deconstruct misguided ways of being that may not serve you.
  </p>
  <h1 class="heading brown">PHARMACOLOGY (MEDICATION MANAGEMENT) - 45min</h1>
  <p>
    I prescribe and manage psychotropic medications for the treatment of mood, anxiety, eating disorders, co-occurring addictions, ADHD, and other conditions. If you both medications and therapy are appropriate for you, I prefer to do both medication management and therapy under my care. On a case by case basis, I will consider split treatment working with your current therapist.
